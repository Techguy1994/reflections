How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   It was easier to see the spelling mistake or to see where has been some changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I coud see the changes made earlier designs and make big differences without wto worry that i lose everything when it does not work or i do not like it

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro is that you can choose when to save and even write a description of what changed, A negative Point is that you can forget to save a change and ou have to start over. ANd you have to decide when to save, so you can make judgement mistakes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git is Code specific and Codes are maybe in different files
    The other programms are just for docouments and images, so not 
    specifically for code saving.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    WIth git log i can see all the changed versions with the description of them. WIth git diff i can see the changes in code between two verions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

   I can play with my code and have in mind that there is a code wihch i can always refer to

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
