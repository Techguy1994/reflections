When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When more people are working in the same repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe i have something written which i do not want to be syncronized

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

When i fork i make a copy of a repository from an other user on github on my github account, when i clone i make a copy of a repository on my own computer and when i branch i open a different path, from the master branch, so different versions of code exist at the same time. When i want to work on my own project online/offline but i get that project from an other user on github than i fork. When i just work on it localy then i clone it and branching is the same reason as above.
